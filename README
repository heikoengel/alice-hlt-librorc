1.0 INSTALLATION

1.1 Prerequisites
Some libraries need to be installed
- rpm and rpmbuild
- PDA in version 7.2.1

Additionally, /bin of the PDA library needs to be in $PATH.

1.2 Compile
The librorc build system is Cmake based. However, there are two additional scrip-
ts to make life easier. First the script ./prepare_build should be called. It se-
ts up Cmake build folders for all three librorc flavours. Afterwards, the builds
can be found in ./build (release or debug is the preferable flavour for users).

Make can now be called to compile the library and tools. Calling make with "rpm"
generates an RPM archive for the current system. The "doc" directive generates a
doxygen based documentation as PDF or HTML (tar.gz).
