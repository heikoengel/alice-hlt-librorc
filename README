1.0 INSTALLATION
1.1 Prerequisites
Some libraries need to be installed
- rpm and rpmbuild
- PDA in version 7.2.1

Additionally, /bin of the PDA library needs to be in $PATH.

1.2 Compile
The librorc build system is Cmake based. However, there are two additional scrip-
ts to make life easier. First the script ./prepare_build should be called. It se-
ts up Cmake build folders for all three librorc flavours. Afterwards, the builds
can be found in ./build (release or debug is the preferable flavour for users).

Make can now be called to compile the library and tools. Calling make with "rpm"
generates an RPM archive for the current system. The "doc" directive generates a
doxygen based documentation as PDF or HTML (tar.gz).


2.0 KNOWN ISSUES
2.1 DMA Remapping Errors
Remapping errors can be related to a faulty IOMMU driver. Such errors usually 
happen during the boot phase. They can be found by typing

$dmesg

[  266.950947] DRHD: handling fault status reg 2
[  266.950956] DMAR:[DMA Write] Request device [85:00.0] fault addr fffff000 
[  266.950958] DMAR:[fault reason 05] PTE Write access is not set

There are two options to fix this problem. First, you can disable the remapping
feature in the kernel configuration:

Device Drivers ---> 
IOMMU Hardware Support  --->
[*]   Support for Intel IOMMU using DMA Remapping Devices
[ ]     Enable Intel DMA Remapping Devices by default

Second, you can disable IOMMU support via kernel parameter:

amd_iommu=off intel_iommu=off

3.0 Changelog

R 0.0.0
