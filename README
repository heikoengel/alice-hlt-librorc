2.0 KNOWN ISSUES

2.1 DMA Remapping Errors
Remapping errors can be related to a faulty IOMMU driver. Such errors usually 
happen during the boot phase. They can be found by typing

$dmesg

[  266.950947] DRHD: handling fault status reg 2
[  266.950956] DMAR:[DMA Write] Request device [85:00.0] fault addr fffff000 
[  266.950958] DMAR:[fault reason 05] PTE Write access is not set

There are two options to fix this problem. First, you can disable the remapping
feature in the kernel configuration:

Device Drivers ---> 
IOMMU Hardware Support  --->
[*]   Support for Intel IOMMU using DMA Remapping Devices
[ ]     Enable Intel DMA Remapping Devices by default

Second, you can disable IOMMU support via kernel parameter:

amd_iommu=off intel_iommu=off


2.2 Link Slowdown
Currently there are several reason known for a link slowdown. This basically 
means that the dma_in_pg test application shows a much lower datarate than 
404 MB/s if just one channel is active.

Try to disable IOMMU support via kernel parameter:

amd_iommu=off intel_iommu=off
